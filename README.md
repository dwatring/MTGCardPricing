# MTG Card Pricing App
Desktop application for searching MTG card prices. I created this application for my local gaming store, [XtremeGames](http://www.xtremegamesonline.com/). I noticed they were entering card information in one-at-a-time on the TCGPlayer website to obtain price information, and then mutliplying that by their buy-ratio of 60%. I wanted to create an application that would speed up the process. Entering data is quick and intuitive, and the total/each card cost is multiplied by the current multiplier.
